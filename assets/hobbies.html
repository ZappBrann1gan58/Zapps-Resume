        <h1>Zapp's Great Many Hobbies!</h1>
        <p>My wife keeps telling me I have too many hobbies.  In all fairness to her It seems like I keep acquiring new ones all the time!</p>
        <h3>3d Printing</h3>
        <p>I actually got into 3d printing in a funny kind of way.  I really wanted a Zapp Brannigan action figure from the TV show Futurama.  Unfortunately they no longer make them so purchasing one meant that I would have to look on eBay and pay an exorbant amount.  At the time the cheapest one I could find was $300.  I knew I could buy a 3D printer for less than that.  I resolved to buy a 3D printer and print my own Zapp figure.</p>

        <p>It took some convicing of my wife to get a 3D printer.  As I said she thinks I have too many hobbies already.  She also heard that 3D printing can be difficult and she was worried that I would be too frustrated getting it to print something that I wouldn't actually use it.  Obviously the first thing I wanted to print was a new Zapp Figure.</p>

        <p>I printed him, successfully I think.  Unfortunately he was unpainted and bare white plastic.  I had to go to the store and get some paints and paint this guy.  Once I completed that, and he still looked ok, I placed him within the case of my custom built desktop PC.</p>

        <p>Here is a pretty good picture of my 3d printer.  I have a Neptune 3 Pro</p>

        <h3>Dungeons and Dragons (D&D)</h3>
        <p>I've played D&D most of my life.  I started playing as a child on the school bus as a way to kill the time, but it wasn't long until I was "convinced" to become a Dungeon Master (DM) to keep the games going and I have been one ever since.  I've probably been a DM since I was 13 or so.</p>
        <p>My first listed hobby of 3D printing has played into my hobby of playing D&D as well though.  I have begun printing my own dungeon tiles and miniatures for my friends and I to use.</p>
